# magento-product-image-converter

Convert magento product images to the specified format

Generates an sql to execute against the magento database in order to update the image links. If you feel brave you can also directly update the database by passing the `-e` option to the command.

Please note that you need to manually clear the products and images cache after updating the images and database.
